# 🇮🇳 India State/UT Guess Game 🧠

This is a fun **Geography Quiz Game** built using **Python Turtle** and **Pandas**.  
The goal of the game is to correctly guess all the **28 States and 8 Union Territories** of India.

---

## 📌 How to Play

- You will see a **blank map of India**.
- A prompt will ask you to **guess the name** of a State or Union Territory.
- If the guess is correct, the name will be **displayed on the map** at the correct location.
- The game ends when:
  - You have guessed all 36 regions correctly 🎯
  - Or you type **"Exit"** to stop the game early

> If you exit early, the game will generate a file called `States_to_learn.csv` which contains the names of the states/UTs you missed. You can use it to study and try again later!
